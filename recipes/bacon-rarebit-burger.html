<h3><strong>Bacon Rarebit Burger</strong></h3>

    <p>Mushrooms, gherkin & soured cream in a soft bun</p>


<h3><strong>What you need</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 chestnut mushrooms</li>
            <li>125 g higher-welfare beef mince</li>
            <li>2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
            <li>1 soft bun</li>
            <li>2 heaped teaspoons soured cream</li>
            <li>1 gherkin</li>
            <li>25 g Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

<h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Trim the stalk and base off each mushroom, giving you a beautiful cross-section 
                (saving the offcuts for another day). Place the mushrooms cut side down on one 
                side of a large dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Cook for 5 minutes while
                 you scrunch and work the mince with your hands. Divide into two equal balls, 
                 flatten each to just under Â½cm thick, then pat and push a rasher of bacon on to
                  each one.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn the mushrooms, put the burgers into the pan, bacon side down, sprinkle 
                with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and fry hard and fast for 2 minutes, 
                pressing down with a fish slice to crisp up the bacon, then flip to fry for just
                1 minute on the other side. Move the mushrooms on top of the burgers, then halve 
                the bun and quickly toast alongside. Remove the bun to a serving board, spread 
                with the soured cream, stack in your burgers and mushrooms, then slice and add 
                the gherkin.</p></li>
            <li><p>Off the heat, coarsely grate the cheese in a pile at the cleanest side of the 
                pan, pour the Worcestershire sauce on top, then tilt the pan and stir vigorously 
                for 30 seconds until it combines into an oozy consistency. Pour the rarebit 
                mixture over the burger stack and put the bun lid on. <strong>Devour.</strong></p></li>
        </ol>
