<h3><strong>Chicken Burrito</strong></h3>

    <p>Don’t you hate it when the filling of your Chicken Burrito falls out 
    and you end up with a chaotic mess on your hands? This one won’t! Juicy, 
    cheesy, flavour loaded chicken burrito filling keeps everything together 
    as you munch your way through.Eat some now, freeze some for later – 
    you can even reheat from frozen!</p>

    <p>One of my biggest gripes about Burritos (other than how ridiculously gigantic
     they can be, far wider than any normal human mouth) is that by the time you get 
     halfway through, you’ve got burrito explosion on your hands.</p>

    <p>Rolling technique comes into play – the firmer it’s rolled, the better it holds 
    together. The filling you choose also has an effect – Shredded Beef and Shredded 
    Chicken holds together pretty well.</p>

    <p>But chopped chicken more often than not comes tumbling out a few bites in. 
    As for the last few bites – forget about it. It’s just one big diabolical mess 
    (albeit a delicious one).</p>

            <li>80 g mature Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Greek yoghurt </li>
        </ul>

<h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Meanwhile, place the 
                chicken thighs between two sheets of greaseproof paper, then bash 
                with the base of a heavy pan to roughly ½cm thick. Pop into a bowl, 
                sprinkle over the paprika, cumin and a lug of oil, and season well 
                with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mix well to coat, then place the chicken onto the hot griddle. 
                Cook for 10 minutes, or until charred and cooked through, turning 
                halfway. Leave to cool slightly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick the coriander 
                leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Heat 1 tablespoon 
                of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic 
                and coriander stalks and fry for 1 minute. </p></li>
            <li><p>Drain, rinse and add the beans, then fry for a further few minutes. 
                Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, or until crisp and piping hot 
                through, stirring occasionally. Finely grate in the lime zest, roughly 
                chop and add half the coriander leaves. Stir well and remove from the 
                heat.</p></li>
            <li><p>Roughly chop the tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring 
                onions, then add to a bowl with the juice of the lime. Roughly chop 
                and add the remaining coriander leaves, mix well and season to taste. 
                Shred the lettuce and cooled chicken.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pop a tortilla onto the griddle for 1 minute to soften, then place 
                onto a board. Spoon one-quarter of the fried rice and beans along the 
                middle, top with a generous spoonful of salsa, a handful of lettuce and 
                one of the shredded chicken thighs. Grate over some cheese and add a 
                spoon of yoghurt. </p></li>
            <li><p>Wrap up the burrito, then tuck in. Repeat with the remaining 
                ingredients, serving as you go.</p></li>
